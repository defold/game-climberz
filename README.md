# Mike Dangers

# Update 1
Defold implementation of the [Mike Dangers game](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mike-dangers/id1171062038?mt=8). The purpose of this project was to replicate the same implementation created and presented by [Emanuele Feronato](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/05/19/html5-game-engine-behind-mike-dangers-made-in-a-few-lines-of-code-with-phaser-and-arcade-physics/) on his excellent blog.

# Update 2
Step two, adding Diamonds, of the [Mike Dangers blog post](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/05/23/mike-dangers-html5-game-engine-made-with-phaser-and-arcade-physics-adding-diamonds-and-real-object-pooling/) is now also replicated in Defold.

Note that in Defold object creation is cheap so there's really no need for object pooling as in the Phaser example created by Emanuel.

# Update 3
Step three, added Spikes, of the [Mike Dangers blog post series](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/05/31/mike-dangers-html5-game-engine-made-with-phaser-and-arcade-physics-adding-spikes-death-and-more-features/) is now replicated in Defold.

# Update 4
Step four, game balance changes, of the [Mike Dangers blog post series](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/06/06/mike-dangers-html5-game-engine-made-with-phaser-and-arcade-physics-optimizing-the-code-and-making-the-game-fair/) is now replicated in Defold.

# Update 5
Step five, the complete game, of the [Mike Dangers blog post series](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2017/06/12/play-ladderz-the-complete-html5-game-based-on-mike-dangers-concept/) is now replicated in Defold.
